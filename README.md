# Automated Trading Strategies

This repository mainly records my understanding of automated trading, it may contains my confusions, but all these inaccurate parts will be corrected in the future.

## Feature Engineering

From my understanding, automated trading strategies generally fall into two main categories:

1. **Risk-Neutral Strategies (Market-Neutral Strategies):**
   - **Description:** These strategies aim to be neutral to overall market movements by simultaneously taking long and short positions. The goal is to profit from relative price movements between assets, rather than from the direction of the market itself. This approach is used by companies like WorldQuant.
   - **Example:** The WorldQuant suggests that they will not try to predict the market direction, always assume equal probability of the market going up or down.
   > My Question: from the overall market, I thought it is a common sense that the market will go up in the long term, so is that reasonable to assume equal probability of the market going up or down to take long and short positions?

2. **Directional Strategies:**
   - **Description:** These strategies involve making directional bets on the market, either long or short, based on the prediction of market movements. Unlike risk-neutral strategies, these are more exposed to market trends and conditions.
   - **Example:** A hedge fund might analyze market trends and economic indicators to predict that the market will rise, thereby taking long positions in a selected portfolio of stocks. This may involves identifying if current market is in a bull or bear state.

Both categories rely heavily on identifying predictive signals or "alphas" to make informed trading decisions.

> Sometimes it is just confusing for me to distinguish the "factors" or "alphas". I think they should be the same things, just an indicator to the price movements. The only problem is the way WorldQuant used to utilize them for portfolio management. As we have known that WorldQuant always keeps a neutral position to the market, the alphas they generated/used are mainly for that purpose. Some other factors that only works for a limited collection of stocks may not be fully utilized (however, higher risk may be involved if using those factors).

### Alpha Mining or Factor Mining

Alpha mining, also known as factor mining, involves identifying and extracting predictive signals (alphas or factors) from historical market data. These signals help forecast future price movements and make trading decisions. Alphas are typically mathematical formulas or algorithms that capture patterns in market data, including price, volume, and other financial metrics.

There are some excellent repositories that may be helpful for feature engineering in trading. Remember, these features are essentially mathematical formulas (like the alpha101), and we can use methods related to program synthesis to develop them.

**Concrete Description and Examples:**

1. **Statistical Arbitrage:**
   - **Description:** This strategy involves identifying pricing inefficiencies between related financial instruments. By statistically analyzing the price relationships between different assets, traders can exploit temporary discrepancies.
   - **Example:** Pairs trading, where a trader identifies two stocks with historically correlated prices. When the price relationship deviates from the historical norm, the trader takes a long position in the underperforming stock and a short position in the outperforming stock, expecting the prices to converge.

2. **Momentum Trading:**
   - **Description:** This strategy is based on the idea that stocks that have performed well in the past will continue to perform well in the near future, and vice versa for underperforming stocks.
   - **Example:** A trader might look for stocks that have shown strong upward momentum over the past six months and take long positions in these stocks, expecting the trend to continue.

3. **Mean Reversion:**
   - **Description:** This strategy assumes that asset prices will revert to their historical mean over time. Traders look for assets that have deviated significantly from their average price and bet on the price moving back towards the mean.
   - **Example:** If a stock's price has fallen significantly below its historical average, a trader might take a long position, anticipating a price correction.

Alphas and factors are critical in these strategies as they provide the statistical basis for making trading decisions. Advanced machine learning and statistical techniques are often employed to discover and validate these signals.

### Portfolio Management

Portfolio management involves constructing and maintaining a collection of financial assets to achieve specific investment goals. This process includes selecting stocks, determining their weights in the portfolio, and dynamically adjusting the portfolio based on market conditions and performance.

### How Portfolio Management is Performed

1. **Stock Selection:**
   - **Description:** The first step in portfolio management is selecting the stocks to include in the portfolio. This involves analyzing various factors such as financial performance, market conditions, and potential for growth.
   - **Method:** Use quantitative models and fundamental analysis to identify stocks with strong financial metrics, solid growth prospects, and favorable market conditions. Techniques such as discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio comparison, and growth rate estimation are commonly used.

2. **Weight Allocation:**
   - **Description:** Determine the proportion of the total portfolio to invest in each selected stock. This is crucial for balancing risk and return.
   - **Method:** Use optimization techniques such as the Markowitz Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to achieve an optimal balance between expected return and risk. The MPT uses the following formula for portfolio variance:

   \[ \sigma_p^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} w_i w_j \sigma_{ij} \]

   Where:
   - \( \sigma_p^2 \) is the portfolio variance.
   - \( w_i \) and \( w_j \) are the weights of assets \( i \) and \( j \) in the portfolio.
   - \( \sigma_{ij} \) is the covariance between the returns of assets \( i \) and \( j \).

3. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - **Description:** Continuously monitor and adjust the portfolio to respond to changing market conditions and performance metrics.
   - **Method:** Implement a rebalancing strategy where the portfolio is periodically reviewed and adjusted to maintain the desired asset allocation. This could involve selling overperforming assets and buying underperforming ones to stick to the predefined risk/return profile. Techniques such as threshold rebalancing and calendar rebalancing are used to maintain the target allocation.

### Selecting High-Performance Stocks

1. **Fundamental Analysis:**
   - **Description:** Evaluate a company's financial statements, management, market position, and growth potential. This involves analyzing metrics such as earnings per share (EPS), return on equity (ROE), debt-to-equity ratio, and revenue growth.
   - **Example:** Analyzing a company's earnings reports, profit margins, and revenue growth to identify financially sound companies with good growth prospects. For instance, identifying a company with consistent revenue growth and low debt may indicate a strong investment opportunity.

2. **Technical Analysis:**
   - **Description:** Use historical price and volume data to identify patterns and trends that suggest future price movements. This method relies on chart patterns and technical indicators to predict stock movements.
   - **Example:** Using moving averages (e.g., 50-day and 200-day moving averages) to identify trend directions, RSI (Relative Strength Index) to gauge overbought or oversold conditions, and MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) to detect changes in momentum. For example, a stock crossing above its 200-day moving average might signal a bullish trend.

3. **Quantitative Models:**
   - **Description:** Develop and use mathematical models to predict stock performance based on various financial metrics and market data. These models often involve statistical and machine learning techniques.
   - **Example:** Using machine learning algorithms such as regression analysis, random forests, or neural networks to analyze historical data and predict future stock prices. For example, a regression model might predict future stock returns based on past performance and economic indicators.

4. **Sentiment Analysis:**
   - **Description:** Analyze news, social media, and other textual data sources to gauge market sentiment. This method uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to interpret and quantify sentiment.
   - **Example:** Using NLP algorithms to assess the sentiment of news articles, social media posts, and analyst reports about a particular stock. For instance, a spike in positive sentiment on social media might indicate a potential upward movement in the stock price.

### Risk Measures and Indicators

In addition to the traditional Sharpe Ratio, there are several other risk measures and performance indicators commonly used in portfolio construction and risk management:

1. **Sharpe Ratio:**
   - **Formula:** \( \text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_p} \)
   - **Explanation:** Measures the excess return per unit of risk. Here, \( R_p \) is the portfolio return, \( R_f \) is the risk-free rate (such as the return on Treasury bills), and \( \sigma_p \) is the standard deviation of the portfolio's returns, representing total risk.

2. **Sortino Ratio:**
   - **Formula:** \( \text{Sortino Ratio} = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_d} \)
   - **Explanation:** Similar to the Sharpe Ratio but only considers downside risk (negative volatility). Here, \( \sigma_d \) is the downside deviation, which measures the volatility of negative returns.

3. **Treynor Ratio:**
   - **Formula:** \( \text{Treynor Ratio} = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\beta_p} \)
   - **Explanation:** Measures the excess return per unit of market risk (beta). Here, \( \beta_p \) is the portfolio beta, which represents the sensitivity of the portfolio's returns to market movements.

4. **Jensen's Alpha:**
   - **Formula:** \( \alpha = R_p - [R_f + \beta_p (R_m - R_f)] \)
   - **Explanation:** Measures the portfolio's excess return over the expected return based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Here, \( R_m \) is the market return, and \( \beta_p \) is the portfolio beta.

5. **Information Ratio:**
   - **Formula:** \( \text{Information Ratio} = \frac{R_p - R_b}{\sigma_{\text{tracking error}}} \)
   - **Explanation:** Measures the return of a portfolio relative to a benchmark, adjusted for risk. Here, \( R_p \) is the portfolio return, \( R_b \) is the benchmark return, and \( \sigma_{\text{tracking error}} \) is the standard deviation of the difference between the portfolio return and the benchmark return (known as tracking error).

6. **Maximum Drawdown (MDD):**
   - **Formula:** \( \text{MDD} = \frac{\text{Trough Value} - \text{Peak Value}}{\text{Peak Value}} \)
   - **Explanation:** Measures the largest peak-to-trough decline in portfolio value over a specified period. This metric highlights the most significant losses experienced by the portfolio, providing insight into downside risk.

7. **Ulcer Index (UI):**
   - **Formula:** \( \text{UI} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^{n} \left(\frac{\text{Trough Value} - \text{Peak Value}}{\text{Peak Value}}\right)^2 } \)
   - **Explanation:** Measures the depth and duration of drawdowns in a portfolio. This index focuses on periods of significant decline, providing a more nuanced view of risk than standard deviation alone.

8. **Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR):**
   - **Formula:** \( \text{CVaR}_{\alpha} = \mathbb{E}[ L \mid L > \text{VaR}_{\alpha} ] \)
   - **Explanation:** Measures the expected loss beyond the Value at Risk (VaR) threshold at a given confidence level \( \alpha \). CVaR provides a more comprehensive view of tail risk by considering the severity of losses in the worst-case scenarios.

### Combining Risk Measures

Combining multiple risk measures provides a comprehensive view of a portfolio's performance, accounting for different dimensions of risk and return. By integrating various metrics, investors can achieve a more balanced and thorough assessment of their portfolio.

For example, a combined return metric might be calculated as:

\[ \text{Combined Return} = \frac{\text{Sharpe Ratio} + \text{Sortino Ratio} + \text{Treynor Ratio} - \text{VaR} - \text{CVaR} - \text{MDD}}{6} \]

This formula averages the positive risk-adjusted return measures (Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, Treynor Ratio) and subtracts the negative risk measures (VaR, CVaR, MDD). This approach ensures that portfolios are evaluated not only based on their returns but also on their risk profiles, providing a more holistic view of performance.

In practice, these combined metrics can be used to rank and select portfolios, guiding investment decisions towards those with better risk-adjusted returns.

### Backtesting

Backtesting is a crucial step in automated trading strategies to evaluate the performance of a trading algorithm or portfolio strategy using historical data. It allows traders to see how their strategies would have performed in the past, providing insights into their potential effectiveness and robustness.

Various frameworks are available to facilitate backtesting, including:

1. **AutoTrader:** A comprehensive framework for building and backtesting trading strategies. It supports various trading algorithms and provides tools for analyzing historical performance, risk, and return metrics.

2. **Intelligent Trading Bot:** A framework that incorporates machine learning techniques for trading. It allows users to develop and test machine learning-based trading strategies, offering features for data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

Backtesting helps identify strengths and weaknesses in strategies, allowing for optimization before deploying them in live trading environments. But one thing I have to mention is that, these are for local backtesting, it requires a lot of data and computational resources to backtest a strategy in a real-world scenario (thousands of stocks, high-frequency data, etc).

Therefore, to get started, we should prefer to use QuantConnect for quick backtesting with reliable data sources.
